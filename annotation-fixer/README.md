# Annotation Fixer

A simple Python script to add body text to annotations captured via this system.

## Requirements
The Python code doesn't rely on any dependencies. With that said, you will need to run the PDF document that you are analyzing through Adobe's extract API and read the JSON it responds to you as a dictionary in order to use this code.

## Testing

Run:

```
python ./tests.py
```

All the tests should pass.
